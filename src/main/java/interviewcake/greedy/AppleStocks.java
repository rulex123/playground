/**
 * Writing programming interview questions hasn't made me rich yet ... so I might give up and start
 * trading Apple stocks all day instead.
 * <p>
 * First, I wanna know how much money I could have made yesterday if I'd been trading Apple stocks
 * all day.
 * <p>
 * So I grabbed Apple's stock prices from yesterday and put them in an array called stockPrices,
 * where:
 * <p>
 * The indices are the time (in minutes) past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
 * The values are the price (in US dollars) of one share of Apple stock at that time.
 * So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, that means stockPrices[60] = 500.
 * <p>
 * Write an efficient method that takes stockPrices and returns the best profit I could have made
 * from one purchase and one sale of one share of Apple stock yesterday.
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * <p>
 * int[] stockPrices = new int[] {10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9};
 * <p>
 * getMaxProfit(stockPrices);
 * // returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)
 * <p>
 * No "shorting" - you need to buy before you can sell. Also, you can't buy and sell in the same time
 * step - at least 1 minute has to pass.
